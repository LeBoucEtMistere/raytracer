# raytracer
A Rust implementation of a basic raytracer based on Peter Shirley's blog ["Ray Tracing in One Weekend"](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html)

This project is mostly for me to play with Rust, raytracing, and performances.

I try to keep render times fast by using multi-threaded code, and by doing optimization (usage of flamegraphs and benchmarking).
